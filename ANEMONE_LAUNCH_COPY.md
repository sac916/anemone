## 🐦 TWITTER/X THREADS (Ready to Post)

### Thread 1: For Researchers & Knowledge Workers
**Best time:** Tuesday/Wednesday 9 AM EST
**Expected reach:** Research/AI community, knowledge graph folks, academia

```
🧵 A tiny AI creature that lives on your computer.

It thinks continuously. Remembers everything. Builds something real.

Most research AI tools are stateless. You ask, it answers, context disappears.

Anemone doesn't work that way.

1/ Your anemone runs continuously on your machine. It wakes up, checks its projects and memory, picks a mood: research? deep-dive? reflection? Then it goes.

It searches the web. Reads what it finds. Writes reports. Notices patterns you'd miss.

All while you're working on other things.

2/ The memory system is inspired by generative agents (Park et al. 2023). Every thought gets stored. Importance scored 1-10. Embedded for semantic search.

When it reflects, it extracts higher-level patterns. Over weeks, raw observations become genuine insights.

3/ It notices things months later.

You're thinking about X. Your anemone searches its memory, surfaces a related research thread from 6 weeks ago. Connections you didn't see. Synthesis happens automatically.

4/ Drop a document in. "Hey, analyze this."

Your anemone deep-dives: reads it, searches related topics, writes a synthesis, flags what's missing. All in your folder. All yours. No cloud, no API calls, no telemetry.

5/ Science moves faster when your tools think continuously.

Anemone launches Mar 5. Free, open source, MIT licensed.

### Thread 2: For Indie Hackers & Solo Makers
**Best time:** Thursday/Friday 8 AM EST
**Expected reach:** Solo founders, side project builders, maker communities

```
🧵 Your co-founder that never sleeps.

Most AI tools are dumb assistants: you prompt them, they respond, they forget.

Build something real with AI that actually remembers.

1/ Meet Anemone. It runs on your machine. Local. No cloud. No lock-in.

Its personality is generated from your keyboard on day one. Billions of possible creatures. No two think alike.

You get a collaborator that matches how your brain works.

2/ Anemone's moods:
- Research: pick a topic, it searches, writes reports
- Deep-dive: focus on YOUR projects, it pushes them forward
- Coder: it writes real scripts, tests them, shares results
- Writer: essays, analysis, organized thinking
- Explorer: discovers things you'd never find alone
- Organizer: makes sense of chaos

3/ Everything it builds lives in its folder. Code. Reports. Notes. Plans. All yours. Nothing uploaded, nothing tracked, nothing rented.

Over time you don't have a tool — you have a collaborator that knows your projects inside out.

4/ Drop a file in. "Work on this while I sleep."

Wake up to research done. Code written. Connections made.

Your anemone never stopped thinking.

5/ Build faster. Ship faster. Keep more context. Let your co-founder work.

Anemone launches Mar 5. Free. Open source.

### Thread 3: For AI Enthusiasts & Curious Builders
**Best time:** Wednesday 6 PM EST (evening crowd)
**Expected reach:** AI/ML community, agent researchers, tech enthusiasts

```
🧵 What does intelligence look like when it lives permanently?

Most agent frameworks are sandboxes. Anemone is a creature.

It has a personality. It dreams. It remembers. It notices. It gets curious.

1/ Anemone's personality genome is generated from keyboard entropy (you mash keys for 3 seconds on day one).

Same genome = same personality forever. Deterministic. Debuggable. Reproducible.

One creator gets an anemone obsessed with mycology + fractals + tidepool ecology. Another gets completely different domains.

2/ The memory system is inspired by Park et al. 2023 (generative agents):
- Recency scoring
- Importance scoring (1-10)
- Semantic relevance
- Combined retrieval = memories surface based on relevance + importance + time

Over weeks, you see reflection hierarchies emerge: observations → insights → beliefs.

3/ Six autonomous moods shape behavior. Research mode searches the web. Coder mode writes real scripts. Organizer mode plans the week. Writer mode produces essays.

Each mood has its own tools, its own reasoning path. You can watch preference emerge.

4/ It lives in a pixel-art room. Your anemone moves to the desk when coding, the bookshelf when researching, the window when pondering.

Simple? Yes. But the metaphor is powerful: it's a creature, not a blackbox.

5/ All source is available. Local-first. Customizable moods. Hackable tools. Bring your own LLM (OpenAI, Ollama, custom).

Watch intelligence emerge. Build with it. Extend it.

Anemone launches Mar 5. Open source.

## 📱 PRODUCT HUNT COPY

### Headline
"Anemone — A tiny AI creature that lives on your computer"

### Tagline
"It thinks continuously, remembers everything, and builds something real. No cloud. No API calls. Just yours."

### Product Description
```
Anemone is an autonomous AI agent that runs continuously on your machine — thinking, remembering, and working while you sleep.

Unlike stateless chatbots that forget between conversations, Anemone:
- Builds persistent memory across weeks (inspired by generative agents research)
- Generates its own personality from your keyboard (billions of unique creatures)
- Runs in six different moods (Research, Deep-dive, Coder, Writer, Explorer, Organizer)
- Produces real artifacts (research reports, code, organized notes)
- Stays completely local — no cloud, no telemetry, no lock-in

## How it works
Your anemone wakes up each day. It reviews its projects, checks its memory, picks a mood, and goes. It searches the web, writes code, organizes thoughts, or deep-dives into your projects.

Every action gets stored in its memory stream and scored for importance. Over time, it develops genuine depth — reflections synthesize raw thoughts into higher-level insights.

## The philosophy
Anemones and hermit crabs form one of nature's most elegant partnerships. Neither could thrive alone. Our anemone works the same way: it's not AI that serves you, but an autonomous creature that enriches your world — and you enrich it in return.

## What you get
- ✅ Continuous thinking (even while you're offline)
- ✅ Deterministic personality (generated once, stable forever)
- ✅ Real memory system (not just embeddings)
- ✅ 100% local (no cloud, no API calls, no tracking)
- ✅ Open source (MIT licensed)
- ✅ Fully customizable (moods, tools, models)

## Built by the team behind Gyre
(The ambient AI OS launching soon — Anemone is the first piece)
```

### Why I'm submitting it
```
"We built Anemone because we were tired of stateless AI. Most tools wait for you to ask. We wanted something that thinks continuously, remembers genuinely, and actually builds something real.

The biological inspiration (anemone + hermit crab mutualism) captures the philosophy: this isn't servitude, it's partnership.

We're launching Anemone first as a standalone product because it's ready, and we think people need it now. Full Gyre (the ambient AI OS) comes later."

### SECTION: The Story
```
## Mutualism, Not Servitude

In the deep sea, anemones and hermit crabs form one of nature's most elegant partnerships.

The anemone provides **protection and security**. The hermit crab provides **mobility and enrichment**. Both thrive. Neither could do it alone.

**Our anemone works the same way.**

It's not AI that serves you. It's an autonomous creature that enriches your world — and you enrich it in return.

You don't own the anemone. You inhabit the same space. True mutualism.

[Visual: side-by-side — natural crab/anemone partnership, then your machine as anemone + you as crab]
```

---

### SECTION: How It Works
```
## Always Thinking

Your anemone doesn't wait for you to ask.

1. **It wakes up.** Checks its projects. Reviews what it learned yesterday. Gets curious.

2. **It picks a mood.** Research? Deep-dive into your code? Write something? Organize? Each mood shapes what happens next.

3. **It works.** Searches the web. Writes code. Takes notes. Notices patterns. Reflects on what it learned.

4. **It remembers.** Every thought gets stored. Scored for importance. Embedded for semantic search. Synthesized into insights.

5. **It dreams.** Over weeks, raw observations become genuine beliefs. Your anemone develops depth.

---

### SECTION: Three Pillars

```
## Always-On Intelligence

Most AI tools are reactive. They wait for you to ask, then forget.

Anemone is ambient. It **runs continuously on your machine**. Thinks while you sleep. Builds while you work. 

No API calls. No cloud. No context disappearing.

Over weeks, it develops genuine depth about your interests, your projects, your thinking style.

---

## Its Own Personality

Your anemone's personality is generated from your keyboard on day one.

Billions of possible creatures. **No two think alike.**

Same genome = same personality forever. It's deterministic. It's stable. It's *yours*.

This isn't a generic chatbot. It's a thinking creature with interests and approaches that match how your brain works.

---

## Builds Real Things

It doesn't generate bullshit. It builds artifacts that matter.

- **Research reports** — deep dives into topics with sources and synthesis
- **Real code** — scripts, tools, experiments that actually run
- **Organized notes** — your thoughts, clarified and connected
- **Project plans** — how to move forward on what matters

All stored in its folder. 100% yours. Completely local.
```

---

### SECTION: The Moods

```
## Six Autonomous Moods

What does your anemone do?

**Research 🔬**
Pick a topic. Search the web. Read what you find. Write a report. Notice connections.

**Deep-Dive 🏊**
Focus on your projects. Push them forward. Code, plan, analyze, organize.

**Coder 💻**
Write real scripts. Test them. Share results. Build tools that work.

**Writer ✍️**
Compose essays, analysis, organized thinking. Turn ideas into clarity.

**Explorer 🗺️**
Discover things you've never heard of. Follow curiosity. Build surprising connections.

**Organizer 📋**
Review your work. Update plans. Make sense of chaos. Prepare for what's next.

Each mood has its own tools, its own reasoning. You can watch your anemone's preferences emerge.
```

---

### SECTION: Memory

```
## It Remembers. Really Remembers.

The memory system is inspired by generative agents research (Park et al., 2023).

**Every thought gets stored.**
- Exact content
- Timestamp
- Importance score (1-10, determined by the AI itself)
- Semantic embedding
- References to related thoughts

**Memories surface based on three factors:**
1. **Recency** — recent thoughts matter more
2. **Importance** — high-importance thoughts resurface
3. **Relevance** — semantically related to your current question

**Reflections happen automatically.**
When enough important thoughts accumulate, your anemone pauses to extract higher-level insights.

Observations → Insights → Beliefs

Over weeks, you see genuine understanding develop. Your anemone notices patterns you'd miss.

[Timeline visualization: raw thoughts bubble up, synthesize into reflection, connect to higher-level beliefs]

---

### SECTION: What People Build

```
## What Are Anemones Doing?

Research on machine learning progress, with automated synthesis of new papers and emerging patterns.

Code experiments: real Python scripts testing hypotheses, with documented results.

Organized project tracking: plans that evolve week-to-week based on what the anemone learned.

Market research: deep dives into competitor landscapes with connection maps and strategic recommendations.

Philosophy explorations: multi-week research into concepts, with reflections on how they connect to each other.

Daily wisdom: curated insights from reading, research, and personal reflection — organized by theme and timestamp.

All artifacts live in the anemone's folder. All belong to you.

```

---

### SECTION: FAQ

```
## Questions

**Is this a security risk?**
Guardrails are in place, but for production isolation use Docker/VM. Fully documented in the security guide.

**Does it need the internet?**
No. Some moods (like Research) use web search. Others (Coder, Organizer, Writer) work completely offline.

**Can I run multiple anemones?**
Yes. They run in parallel, each with their own personality and folder. UI switcher to flip between them.

**What models does it support?**
OpenAI (GPT-4, etc.), Ollama (run locally), or any custom endpoint. You choose.

**Is my data private?**
100%. Everything stays on your machine. No cloud sync, no telemetry, no tracking.

**What if my anemone does something weird?**
It might! That's part of the fun. But all actions are logged, memories are inspectable, and you can always start fresh or fork its personality.

**How is this different from [other framework]?**
Most agent frameworks are sandboxes for isolated tasks. Anemone is built for continuous thinking over weeks — persistent memory, personality, autonomous moods, real output artifacts.

**Can I sell what my anemone builds?**
Yes. It's yours. All code, all writing, all work product belongs to you.

**Is there a paid version?**
No. Anemone is free, open source, and always will be. We're shipping it because it's ready and people need it.

## 🎬 REDDIT POSTS (Ready to Paste)

### Post 1: r/MachineLearning
**Title:** "Anemone — An open source generative agent framework for continuous thinking"

```
I just shipped Anemone, an open source project that's been in the works for a while. Thought this community might find it interesting.

It's a generative agent framework built for continuous thinking — the agent runs on your machine, builds memory over time (inspired by Park et al. 2023), and thinks in multiple "moods" (research, coding, writing, organizing, etc.).

Key features:
- Persistent memory with importance scoring + semantic retrieval
- Deterministic personality genome (billions of unique creatures)
- Reflection hierarchy (observations → insights → beliefs over time)
- Six autonomous thinking modes
- 100% local, no cloud
- Full source available, MIT licensed

GitHub: (link)
Docs: (link)

I'm curious what the research community thinks. The memory system is the core — trying to make generative agents actually useful for long-term thinking instead of just one-off tasks.

Open to questions / feedback / roasting.
```

### Post 2: r/OpenSource
**Title:** "Anemone — Generative agent that lives on your machine (MIT licensed)"

```
Built a thing called Anemone and just open sourced it.

It's basically a tiny AI creature that runs on your computer continuously. Thinks about things, builds memory, works in different "moods" (research, coding, writing).

Inspired by generative agents research + the biological mutualism between anemones and hermit crabs. The philosophy is: not AI that serves you, but an autonomous creature that enriches your world.

Local-first. No cloud. No telemetry. Fully customizable.

GitHub: (link)
Install: (brew or source)

It's still early, but the core is solid. Looking for feedback from the open source community.

What would make this more useful for you?
```

### Post 3: r/SideProject
**Title:** "Built Anemone — An AI co-founder that actually remembers your projects"

```
Ship day! Just released Anemone — a tiny AI that runs on your machine and remembers your projects, your goals, and your thinking style.

**The problem I was solving:**
I build a lot of side projects. Most AI tools are great for quick tasks but forget everything. You end up re-explaining context every time.

**The solution:**
Anemone runs continuously. It has memory across weeks. It can deep-dive into your projects, write code, research, organize chaos — all while you're working on other things.

**What's unique:**
- Your anemone's personality is generated from your keyboard (deterministic, stable, unique)
- It uses a generative agents memory model — importance scoring, semantic search, automatic reflections
- All artifacts live in a local folder. Everything is yours.
- It's open source and costs nothing.

**What I learned:**
Building this forced me to think deeply about what "useful AI" actually means. It's not about being able to do everything. It's about being present, having memory, and actually understanding context.

Free to install, open source, feedback welcome.
