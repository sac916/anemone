## What is Anemone?

Anemone is an autonomous AI agent that runs continuously on your machine. It:

- **Thinks continuously** — doesn't wait for you to ask
- **Remembers everything** — persistent memory across weeks
- **Builds real things** — research reports, code, organized notes
- **Has personality** — generated from your keyboard, unique to you
- **Stays local** — no cloud, no telemetry, no lock-in

## Get Started

```bash
$ brew install anemone
$ anemone init
$ anemone run
```

## Philosophy

Anemones and hermit crabs form one of nature's most elegant partnerships. The anemone provides protection and security. The hermit crab provides mobility and enrichment. Both thrive.

Our anemone works the same way — it's not AI that serves you, but an autonomous creature that enriches your world. True mutualism.
