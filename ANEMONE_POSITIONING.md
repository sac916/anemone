# Anemone Launch Strategy — anemone.getgyre.com

**Target Ship Date:** March 5, 2026
**Owner:** Jess (Marketing)
**Status:** In Development

---

## 🪸 Core Positioning

### The Story (Biological Mutualism)

Anemones and hermit crabs form one of nature's most elegant mutualisms:
- **Anemone** provides: protection, security, a place to build
- **Hermit crab** provides: mobility, food, enrichment, shared learning
- **Result:** Both thrive. Neither could do it alone.

**Our architecture mirrors this:**
- Autonomous anemone agents live permanently on your machine
- Continuously building a body of work, enriching context
- You visit, benefit from enriched context, leave learnings behind
- True mutualism — not "AI that serves you," but "an autonomous creature that enriches your world"

---

## 📋 Positioning Statement

**For:** Solo makers, researchers, and curious builders who want AI that thinks continuously
**Who:** Are tired of stateless chatbots and one-off API calls
**Anemone:** Is an autonomous AI creature that lives on your computer permanently
**That:** Remembers everything, builds a body of work, and actively enriches your thinking over time
**Unlike:** Traditional AI assistants that wait for commands and forget everything between sessions
**Because:** Intelligence that lives alongside you — not rented from the cloud — creates genuine partnership

---

## 🎯 Three Messaging Pillars

### Pillar 1: Always-On Intelligence
**Headline:** "Your AI doesn't stop thinking when you're not asking"

- Anemone runs continuously on your machine
- Thinks while you sleep, builds while you work
- No API calls, no cloud, no waiting — just persistent presence
- Over weeks/months, it develops genuine depth about your interests

**Why it matters:** Most AI tools are reactive. Anemone is ambient — present without demanding attention.

**Proof points:**
- Continuous thinking loop (mood-driven research, planning, reflection)
- Memory system inspired by generative agents (not just embeddings)
- Reflection hierarchy (raw thoughts → insights → beliefs over time)

---

### Pillar 2: It Has a Personality (You Generate It)
**Headline:** "A creature with its own mind — determined by your keyboard"

- Anemone's personality is generated from keyboard entropy on day one
- 50 curiosity domains × 16 thinking styles × 8 temperaments = billions of unique creatures
- Same genome = same personality forever. It's deterministic, it's yours.
- No two anemones think alike

**Why it matters:** This isn't a generic chatbot. It's *your* anemone — a thinking creature with interests that match how your brain works.

**Proof points:**
- Personality genome system (see identity.py)
- Domain-driven curiosity (mycology + fractal geometry + tidepool ecology, etc.)
- Deterministic personality = reproducible, provable, debuggable

---

### Pillar 3: It Builds Something Real
**Headline:** "A researcher, a coder, a note-taker — whatever you need"

- Writes research reports, extracts insights, builds connections
- Codes real scripts and tools, tests them, shares results
- Organizes your thoughts into projects and plans
- All artifacts live in its folder — totally yours, completely local

**Why it matters:** Over time, your anemone becomes a collaborator, not just a tool. It has a body of work. It *does* things.

**Proof points:**
- 6 autonomous "moods" (Research, Deep-dive, Coder, Writer, Explorer, Organizer)
- Writes to disk continuously (projects/, research/, notes/, logs/)
- Memory stream + planning system = intentional, coherent work over time

---

## 👥 Audience Breakdown

### Audience 1: Researchers & Knowledge Workers
**Who:** PhD students, academics, indie researchers, knowledge consultants
**Pain:** Running dozens of web searches, drowning in documents, no system for synthesis
**Anemone's hook:** "Your research assistant never sleeps. It notices patterns you'd miss."

**Messaging:**
- Autonomous research that runs parallel to your work
- Semantic search over memory (finds connections months later)
- Reflection system generates insights automatically
- Focus mode: deep-dive on any document; anemone does the related research

**Copy angle:** "Science moves faster when your tools think continuously."

**Launch tactics:**
- Academic Twitter (reaching out to researchers with threads)

- ArXiv community (post preprints, engage on semantic scholar)
- Email outreach to knowledge graph researchers

---

### Audience 2: Indie Hackers & Makers
**Who:** Solo founders, side-project builders, open-source maintainers
**Pain:** Context switching, tool fatigue, forgetting what mattered last week
**Anemone's hook:** "Your co-founder that never sleeps and remembers everything."

**Messaging:**
- Local-first, no cloud lock-in
- Runs on your machine, extends with your tools
- Remembers project context across weeks (no starting over)
- Can write code, run experiments, document findings

**Copy angle:** "Build faster when your tools remember your vision."

**Launch tactics:**

---

### Audience 3: AI Enthusiasts & Curious Builders
**Who:** People fascinated by AI agents, generative agents, emergent behavior
**Pain:** Want to play with agent tech but existing projects are either overly simple or enterprise-locked
**Anemone's hook:** "Watch intelligence emerge. It's a tamagotchi that does real research."

**Messaging:**
- Playground for agent behavior (personality genome, mood system, reflection)
- Based on Park et al. 2023 (generative agents) — proven architecture
- Pixel-art room, emergent personality, continuous learning
- Fully hackable (source available, local, customizable)

**Copy angle:** "What does intelligence look like when it lives permanently?"

**Launch tactics:**
- Twitter/X AI community (threads on agent behavior, personality emergence)
- AI safety/alignment spaces (LessWrong, alignment forum)
- Dev YouTube (long-form review/tutorial angle)
- GitHub (this is your distribution channel)

## 📄 Landing Page Structure

### Hero Section
```
Headline: "A tiny AI creature that lives on your computer."
Subheading: "It thinks continuously. Remembers everything. Builds something real. And it's yours alone."

Visual: Animated pixel-art anemone in a tidepool (looping, subtle motion)

CTA: "Install Anemone" (links to install) | "See How It Works" (scroll)
```

### Section 2: The Story (Biological Inspiration)
```
Headline: "Mutualism, Not Servitude"

Copy:
"Anemones and hermit crabs form one of nature's most elegant partnerships.
The crab provides mobility and food. The anemone provides protection and enrichment.
Both thrive. Neither could do it alone.

Our anemone works the same way. It's not AI that serves you.
It's an autonomous creature that enriches your world — and you enrich it in return."

Visual: Side-by-side illustration of crab/anemone in tidepool, then anemone (your machine) + you (the hermit crab)
```

### Section 3: How It Actually Works
```
Headline: "Always Thinking"

Three-panel flow:
1. Your anemone wakes up, checks its projects and memory
2. Picks a mood, searches the web, writes code, organizes thoughts
3. Reflects on what it learned, updates its understanding, gets curious about the next thing

(Include short GIF or demo video of the thinking loop)
```

### Section 4: Three Pillars (with details)

**Pillar 1: Always-On Intelligence**
- Runs continuously on your machine
- Thinks while you work and sleep
- No cloud, no API calls, no context disappearing

**Pillar 2: Its Own Personality**
- Personality generated from your keystrokes on day one
- Each anemone is unique and deterministic
- Different curiosity domains, thinking styles, temperaments

**Pillar 3: Builds Real Things**
- Writes research reports, code, notes, ideas
- Organizes projects and plans over time
- All artifacts are 100% yours, completely local

### Section 5: The Moods (Show Personality)
```
What does your anemone do?

🔬 Research — Pick a topic, search the web, write reports
🏊 Deep-dive — Focus on your projects and push them forward
💻 Coder — Write real scripts, tools, and experiments
✍️ Writer — Compose analysis, essays, organized thinking
🗺️ Explorer — Discover things you've never heard of
📋 Organizer — Review work, update plans, make sense of chaos
```

### Section 6: Memory (The Secret Sauce)
```
Headline: "It Remembers. Really Remembers."

Explanation of the memory system:
- Every thought gets stored (importance scored 1-10)
- Semantic search finds related insights from weeks ago
- Reflection system automatically extracts higher-level patterns
- Over time, your anemone develops genuine depth

Visual: Timeline showing thought → reflection → higher reflection (layered understanding)
```

### Section 7: Real Usage (What People Build)
```
"What are anemones doing right now?"

Example projects/outputs:
- Research on X topic → reports + connections
- Code experiments → real scripts, tested
- Organized notes → project plans that evolved over time
- Insights → things the creator didn't see coming
```

### Section 8: Install & Get Started
```
Installation:

$ brew install anemone
$ anemone init    # Name it, generate personality, set config
$ anemone run     # It wakes up

Watch it think in the pixel-art room.
Drop files in. Have conversations. Let it do its work.

(Include code snippet showing setup flow)
```

### Section 9: The Ecosystem
```
Headline: "Extend It"

Moods are customizable
Models are swappable (OpenAI, Ollama, local)
Tools can be added
Output formats can be automated

(GitHub link, examples)
```

### Section 10: FAQ / Concerns
```
"Is this a security risk?"
— Guardrails are in place, but for real isolation use a container. Fully documented.

"Does it require the internet?"
— No. Moods can be research-based (web searches) or internal (deep-dive, coding, organizing).

"Can I run multiple anemones?"
— Yes. They run in parallel, each with their own personality and folder.

"What models does it support?"
— OpenAI, Ollama (local), or custom endpoints. Bring your own LLM.

"Is my data private?"
— 100%. Everything stays on your machine. No cloud sync, no telemetry.
